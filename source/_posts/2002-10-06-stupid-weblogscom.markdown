Somehow, weblogs.com is unable to resolve my hostname (slackerbit.ch), so my blog doesn't show up on their recently updated list.
Not that I am expecting huge amounts of visitors via weblogs.com, but I use it to check out interesting-sounding blogs (for example, I just had to check out a site called [iwilldare](http://www.iwilldare.com), and lo and behold, it was a Mats fan), and maybe someone would find this bunch of text interesting.
