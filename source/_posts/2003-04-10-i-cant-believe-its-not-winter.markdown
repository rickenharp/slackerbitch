This morning, my windshield was frozen over with a thick crust of ice.
That's not something I want to experience in April. I mean, there's always talk about global warming, and now it's the beginning of spring, I'm freezing my ass off, and my car looks like it comes fresh out of the icebox.

I mean, spring. Soft breezes, short skirts, flowers blooming, short skirts, birds chirping. Did I mention short skirts? How is that gonna work, if it keeps snowing? Feh!
