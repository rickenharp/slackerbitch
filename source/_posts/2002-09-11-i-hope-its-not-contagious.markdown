Am I the only one who thinks that people should **not** be singing or humming at 7 in the morning?  

It's unnatural. I am just barely awake at that time, waiting for the coffee to kick in, and hearing someone sing "I've been looking for freedom" is not helping.
I am not even awake enough for a proper rant, dammit!






This reminds me, we're out of coffee at the office, which has to be taken care of ASAP. But looking out the window, the weather is not really making me want to go outside.  Time to choose between comfort and addiction...
