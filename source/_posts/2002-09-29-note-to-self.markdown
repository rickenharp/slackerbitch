Gotta get the following CDs:




  * Beck: Sea Change  

_The Golden Age_ rocks, I've been listening to it on repeat for a while now and am still not tired of it


  * Ryan Adams: Demolition  

The same goes for _Jesus (don't you touch my baby)_, I've got a playlist consisting just of those two songs.
