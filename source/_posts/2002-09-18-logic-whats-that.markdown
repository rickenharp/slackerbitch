Just heard on the news, that an alarming amount of kids in Germany are overweight. And what does the government plan to do against it? They want to ban advertising of sweets and high-fat food.  

Riiight, because the only reason that kids eat so much is because of advertising. WTF happened to parents and **raising** your kids, telling them not to eat so much junk food and generally **being responsible**?
