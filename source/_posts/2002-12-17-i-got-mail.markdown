Just picked up a package at the post office on my way home. Finally, [the book](http://www.somewordsspoken.com) has arrived!
It is even autographed by the two [amazing](http://strangeangel.net) [authors](http://www.ihaveasecret.com), who I had the great fortune to meet in person last year during my visit to Toronto.
I really have to get back there ASAP. I miss those crazy canadians, eh! ;-)
