Today, I saw how my website looks in IE. And it looked like ass. After futzing around a little with the CSS, at least I have the link div next to the content div.
But so far I habe not been able to make the whole thing centered. It works in Mozilla, by using `margin: auto`, but IE seems totally unimpressed by that...
Well, back to the drawing board.
