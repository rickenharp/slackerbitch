I've been wondering, what other types of content could benefit from the TrackBack System, besides weblogs? And what are requirements to use TrackBack?
As far as I understand it, the minimum you need is a stable URL that you can use as a key. So, almost any system that has individual pages for its content could be retrofitted.
Looking at some projects at work, I did find two projects that could easily have TrackBack grafted on. But what would be the benefit? The selling point? I'm a coder, so I'd do it for the sheer hack value, but these things have to sold to bean counters and suits, and they don't take "Because it's there" as an answer.
