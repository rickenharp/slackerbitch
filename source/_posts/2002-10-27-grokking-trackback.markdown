I think I finally understand the [TrackBack](http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_trackback.html) system now.
I mean, I understood the basics, but after trying for about 30 minutes to have the TrackBack option appear in the MT Bookmarklet, I was surprised to find out, that if there's only one TrackBack item, then it's automatically pinged.
D'oh!
