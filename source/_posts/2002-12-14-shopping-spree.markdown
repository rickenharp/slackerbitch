Birgit and I went to [Ikea](http://www.ikea.de/) today, which was a lot of fun. I could have spent ages in the kitchen utensils part, I had the nagging feeling that I was missing one crucial instrument. But I could not for the life of me figure out, what exactly I was missing.
And I found the most gorgeous shelves for my DVDs, but they are neither in the catalogue, nor on their website. Luckily, a [groups.google.com](http://groups.google.com/) search turned up [two](http://www.hoice.net/custom/dvd1.jpg) [pictures](http://www.hoice.net/custom/dvd2.jpg) of the shelves.
Each holds about 50 DVDs, so with 4 of them, I should have enough space for the near future.
