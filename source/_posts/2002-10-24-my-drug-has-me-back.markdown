I am a weak person. I ran back into the arms of caffeine.
Looking through the office fridge, I found a carton of milk. I thought it was an ancient carton, half full and by now inhabited by sentient lactose, so I decided to throw it out. But it turns out, it was still full and sealed. And since I hate to let things go to waste and being incredibly tired this morning, I admitted defeat and brewed a few cups of the dark nectar.
And boy, is it good to be back.
I guess I do need one of those:
