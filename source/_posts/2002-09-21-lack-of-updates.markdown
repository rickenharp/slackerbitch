The reason why I haven't updated for a while: [Unreal Tournament 2003 Demo](http://www.unrealtournament2003.com)  

I've been playing the Linux demo for a while now, and it's a great game. What really impresses me, is that is playable on my rather old box (Duron 800, Geforce 2 MX). OK, it's just in 640*480, but it works, is reasonably fast, and great fun.
