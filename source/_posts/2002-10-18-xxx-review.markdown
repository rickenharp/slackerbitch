Despite having to see the movie with some of the rudest people in the audience I have ever seen(*), I had a blast. This movie was a thrill ride, and the stunts were just spectacular.
What impressed me the most was the avalanche sequence, with ths subwoofers booming, it felt like almost being there. Sure, there may be plotholes and logical inconsistencies, but I don't really care, because this movie is about entertainment, and it **did** entertain me. A lot.
The last half hour had me hanging on the edge of my seat, being totally immersed in the action on screen. The last movie to do this was Matrix, which also had me just sitting there, letting the adrenaline rush through me and enjoying the fireworks.
So, the overall rating is, see it, if you haven't already.

And they showed the trailer for _The Two Towers_, which looks **very** promising.

(*) Maybe it's just me, but talking loudly during the film is just plain rude. Even more rude is popping the bottle of your softdrink so it flies through half the cinema. And why does everybody think it's OK to just dump the popcorn onto the floor and walk all over it?
Yes, they do clean the cinema, but that does not mean you **have** to make a mess out of the place.
I was especially annoyed as the guy next to me got the rest of a big bucket of popcorn dumped all over him at the end of the movie. Luckily, my jacket was not in the "danger zone".
