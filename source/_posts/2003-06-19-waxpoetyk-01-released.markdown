After some more hacking, I am now releasing version 0.1 of waxpoetyk, codenamed "World Class Fad".
There's a lot of debug info printed out on the console, the UI isn't quite finished, but it basically does what it is supposed to do.
You can grab the tarball [here](/archives/waxpoetyk-0.1.tar.gz).
Use the code at your own risk, I am not responsible if it eats your hard drive, makes your hair fall out or hides weapons of mass destruction in your closet.
