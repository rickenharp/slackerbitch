Whoever thought up all this Java Servlet stuff? I mean, I am a unix guy, I have no problems with text config files.
But Jesus, this whole XML crap you have to wade through to get Apache Tomcat (or Jakarta, or Catalina, or whatever it is called today) running is just a big pain in the ass. All I want to do is install one JSP and one Servlet, so we can run some tests on it. But I cannot find the documentation on how to do that.

Give me PHP, or mod_perl or even plain CGI any day over this overengineered piece of rubbish!
