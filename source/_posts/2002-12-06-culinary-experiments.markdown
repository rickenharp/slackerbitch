Since the Beaujolais Primeur I bought recently was a little too sour for my tastes, and I did not want to throw it away, I came up with the idea, to just add a little wine to the next chocolate cake I bake. Instead of adding 100 ml milk, I just add 50 ml milk and 50 ml wine. Or something like that.
I think might have overshot the 50 ml wine mark a little, though. But it's too late, the cake is in the oven now, and so far, it smells quite nice. Updates will follow, as soon as the cake has been tasted.
