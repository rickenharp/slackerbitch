I've been working on marrying [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org) and [Mason](http://www.masonhq.com), and so far, the results look pretty good.
Coupled with some CSS-fu, I might be able to create a consistent layout, which does not look like the default template of MT, even though it's a nice template.

The power and flexibility of MT have really impressed me. It's really nice piece of work, and if all goes well, I'll shell out the 20 bucks for a donation, it's definitely worth it.
  *[MT]: Movable Type
