I bought a new toothbrush today, and looking at the packaging, it said "interactive".  

What's that supposed to mean? Sure, I am _interacting_ with the toothbrush, I move it, and it brushes, but I wouldn't call that a distinguishing feature that has to be printed on the packaging. I actually expect that from each and every toothbrush.  

In fact, I would be sorely disappointed, if I ever got one that _wasn't_ interactive, that would be quite a drag every morning.






Interactively yours,  

Alex
