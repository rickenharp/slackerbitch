Browsing through my referrer logs, I came across [this <del>french</del> swiss site about blogging](http://www.slash.com.ch/no68/68-newsmain.htm), which has listed me at the bottom, with the comment "anti weblogger !"
I mean, I am anti pretty much anything at one time or another, but so far, I have not been anti weblogging. Or maybe anti means "cool frood" in french...
