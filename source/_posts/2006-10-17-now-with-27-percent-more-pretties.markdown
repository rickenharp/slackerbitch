It's all about the branding, you know?

That's why all my blogs (both of them) now share the same theme ([Scribbish](http://quotedprintable.com/pages/scribbish)), even though they run on two completely different engines.

To get you own WP-blog all pretty-like, you can grab [ScribbishWP](http://pittcrew.net/geekblog/scribbishwp/). You won't regret it. :)
