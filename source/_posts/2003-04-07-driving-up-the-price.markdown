OK, now I have also laid claim to this blog, but it seems that it is still a long way until the IPO.
I should have started blogshares way back when I got linked by [SixLog](http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/02/secure_emailtob.shtml), [David Raynes](http://www.rayners.org/archives/000179.php) and [Ben Hammersley](http://www.benhammersley.com/archives/003984.html).
Ah, the good old days, when I wasn't yet motivated by greed... :-)
