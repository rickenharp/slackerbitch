Checking my logfiles, I came across a weird user agent, "obidos-bot". I know that obidos is something Amazon uses, but I was curious. A google search later, I found the answer:  

[onfocus.com : Weblog BookWatch](http://www.onfocus.com/bookwatch/), a website that checks recently updated blogs for links to books and generating a list of the most mentioned books.  

Now that's a neat idea.
