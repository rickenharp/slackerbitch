After seeing [Phils](http://www.interalia.org) Red Hat 8.0 [screenshot](http://www.interalia.org/archives/001400.php), I think I should spend some more time on frobnicating my Psyche installation at work.
And since I have now found out some new configuration tips for screen, I might be able to whip it into usable shape. Especially, since I have now a 19" monitor at word, running 1152*864. Schmooove!
