It's all or nothing,  

and nothing's all I ever get  

Everytime I turn it on,  

 I burn it up and burn it out  

  

It's always something,  

 there's always something going wrong  

That's the only guarantee,  

 that's what this is all about  

  

It's a never ending attack,  

everything's a lie and that's a fact  

Life is a lemon  

and I want my money back
