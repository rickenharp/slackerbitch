How am I **ever** gonna make it big on [Blogshares](http://www.blogshares.com) if this blog keeps shriveling up to one measly entry on the front page?

Dammit, I need action, adventure, excitement. With lots of photo opportunities, if possible.

Maybe I should become a pirate. Blogging the Seven Seas, taking from the rich and converting it all to rum, or something like that...

This rant...needs more coffee!
