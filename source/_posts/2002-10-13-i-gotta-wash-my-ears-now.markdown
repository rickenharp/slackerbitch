I still can't believe it. They made a cover version of Iggy Pop's "Candy", one of my favourite pieces. This would not be so bad, if the cover wasn't




  * abominably bad


  * and done by a band called "Killer Barbies", together with Bela B. of "Die Ã„rzte" fame


So instead of Kate Pierson, we hear some chick that can't even speak proper english, for crying out loud! Well, the only thing I can do to get that out of my head is to put the original "Candy" on repeat for a while, to get the yucky feeling out of my ears...
