So I read about [Trepia](http://www.trepia.com) today, and it sounded pretty interesting. So I actually booted my dusty Windows partition, downloaded the installer, installed the thing and tried to register.
That is where I hit a major road block. The stupid thing just stalls, showing a frozen progress bar and the words "Registering".
But maybe I can still find people in my neighborhood this way, by listening for screams of frustration... :-)
