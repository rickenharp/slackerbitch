I tried my first Beaujolais Primeur today, and I have to say...Yuck!
Normally, I like red wines, I have tried a few. But this one, Marquis de Valclair Beaujolais-Villages Primeur, was sour as hell. I would even go so far and say it was vile. It smelled pretty good, but the taste... *shudder*
Even after one glass, I bet there'll be hell to pay tomorrow morning.
