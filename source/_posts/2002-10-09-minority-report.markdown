I went to see [Minority Report](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0181689) with [Birgit](http://www.aerin.de) yesterday.
To avoid spoilers, I won't post it on the front page.

Wow. That was my first thought about this movie.
First, it looked _amazing_. The cars, the abundance of advertisements, and, most of all, the technology. When Cruise is working on the huge screen, shuffling around images, it looks like a conjurer working his magic.
Second, the plot. I was really into it, suspending my disbelief for the 145 minutes this film was running. The world absorbed me, because it was futuristic, but still a lot like the present, so you could easily relate to it. The shock effects all worked, there were a few times that I almost jumped out of my seat, and I wasn't the only one.
But the movie also has some very humorous scenes, for example there's one scene where Cruise is desperately running after a pair of eyeballs he just dropped.

I think, this movie is definitely an Oscar candidate, it was very entertaining, and I would even go so far and say it was thought provoking, with the theme of fate and predetermination.
