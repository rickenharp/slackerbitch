I have looked at quite a few RSS aggregators and most of them have more features than you can shake a stick at.
At the moment I am using Amphetadesk, but I am looking for something really simple, that just





  * runs on a server, so I can read my feeds from anywhere


  * keeps a list of all the feeds I read


  * checks the feeds regularly, while being net-friendly (conditional GET, etc.)


  * shows me a list of all the recent entries that I haven't seen before. Just a link and a title



Because even though I use an aggregator, I still visit every article and just use Amphetadesk as a glorified bookmark manager.

Does such a beast already exist?
