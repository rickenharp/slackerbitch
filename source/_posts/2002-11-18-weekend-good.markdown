That was my kind of weekend.
It started with my new TV arriving saturday morning. Call me materialistic, but that thing was the missing piece in my living room. And now Ican re-watch all my DVDs on the 16:9 screen. 
The TV was put to good use on sunday, when [Birgit](http://www.aerin.de) came over to continue our Buffy-thon. We're now 4 episodes into season three (the best season, IMHO), and I can't wait for season 4, since that is in 16:9 *drool*
And sunday afternoon, it was bakin' time. Since the holiday season is approaching, I made coco macaroons, which seemed just about festive enough.
And they actually taste good.
