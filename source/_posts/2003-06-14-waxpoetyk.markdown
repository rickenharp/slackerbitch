This is what I have been hacking on lately:
![waxpoetyk.png](http://slackerbit.ch/archives/waxpoetyk.png)
A new client for [MovableType](http://www.movabletype.org), written in [Python](http://www.python.org/) using the [wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org/) library (which explains the atrocious spelling of the name).
It's far from finished, but it can already post to a blog. But before I publish it, I want to get the preview functionality going and give it all the functionality of the "Post to MT Weblog" bookmarklet (allowing comments, allowing trackbacks, text formatting).
