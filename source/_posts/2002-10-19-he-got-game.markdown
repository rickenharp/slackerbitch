SPIEL 2002 today was a blast. My feet hurt, I am tired, and I spent much more money than I should have. So it was a full success :-)
I finally got to meet Brian VanCamp, after having done some trades and display purchases through him. And he proceeded to kick my ass, once while demoing [Cannibal Pygmies in the Jungle of Doom](http://www.shadowfist.com/html/store_cannibal.htm), and once in a 3 player [Shadowfist](http://www.shadowfist.com) match. And I got my ass kicked again in another 3 player match. But I got some good deck building tips, so maybe I'll be able to finally bring my "You screw me, I screw you more" Jammer deck up to speed.
I also heard that the guy doing all those Battleground Ruhrgebiet tourneys in Dortmund wants to do a german shadowfist portal, so I think I should get in touch with him, that sounds like a neat project, maybe they could use some help.
