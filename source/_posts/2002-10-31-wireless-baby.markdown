My WLAN card came in the mail today, and since you can't do much with just the card, I went into town after work to get an access point to.
I was hoping to pick up one from Netgear, but I couldn't find any, so I settled for a LG one.
After some problems setting up the AP (they managed to print the wrong default password in the Quickstart manual), I am now surfing wireless with my notebook on my bed, and streaming my MP3s via NFS. I love this technology.
I can finally say goodbye to that ugly CAT5 cable in my living room.
