After reading about [Anders Jacobsens](http://www.jacobsen.no/anders/) [MT installation](http://www.jacobsen.no/anders/blog/archives/2002/08/06/my_movable_type_installation.html) and his subsequent articles on optimizing MovableType, I implemented most of his suggestions about how to set up the archives too be search engine friendly.
I also converted from Berkley DB to MySQL, so that I could use [Eliot Landrums](http://eliot.landrum.cx) [MT-RefSearch](http://eliot.landrum.cx/archives/2002/12/12/07_the_wonderwhammy_release.php)
The next step will be implementing all those other improvements, like related entry links, proper RSS feeds, etc.
