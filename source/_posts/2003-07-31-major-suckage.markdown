Yesterday, I was layed off. To be precise, both me an my coworker got laid off, because the company just could not afford us any longer.
So I spent this morning at the unemployment office, where I was told, that the situation in the job market isn't looking too good. But I knew that already.
So now it's time to hunt down any leads I can find.

You don't happen to need a ((Perl|PHP)-Programmer || Linux Sysadmin ), do you? ;-)
