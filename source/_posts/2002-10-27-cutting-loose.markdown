Not to be left behind the technology curve, I decided to scrounge ebay for a "cheap" WLAN card. I mean, if they start selling this technology at [the supermarket](http://www.lidl.de/), it's time to catch up, especially if you're kinda geeky. :-)
And I did find one, an Enterasys RoamAbout. It's an Orinoco Silver card, so it works with Linux. With only the card, I won't be able to do much, but at least I can start war driving. Well, since I would have to use public transportation for that, I better rethink that....
