I just wanted to post a comment to [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org), and lo and behold, there's a checkbox 'Don't apply +1 bonus'. It seems that I somehow amassed enough Karme to get the +1 bonus.






In other news, I went through some of my older CDs yesterday and I wondered what the respective bands were doing, and if there would ever be a second CD.  

A check of three bands revealed that all three have a new album coming out this year.







  * [SR-71](http://www.sr-71.net/): _Tomorrow_, coming in October


  * [3 Doors Down](http://www.3doorsdown.com/):_Away from the sun_, coming in November


  * [Nine Days](http://www.nine-days.com/): _So Happily Unsatisfied_(what a cool title), coming in October





I'm really looking forward to that, since I always thought, those bands would never make more than one album.
