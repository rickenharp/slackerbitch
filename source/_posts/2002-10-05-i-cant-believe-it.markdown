I just came back from grocery shopping and putting all the stuff from the car in front of the door. First, I put a twelve-pack of milk cartons there. When I came back with the second bag, it looked like a dog had peed at the bottom of the carton. Looking around, I saw one of my neighbours walking with her dog.  

I can't believe the fucking nerve of some people. I wonder what she would say, if I would do the same...
