To prepare for the impending redesign of my sites, I started to remove some rather silly things I had grafted onto these pages. The top referer links have gone, and I also removed the mt-refsearch stuff, mainly because this defeats the cacheability of these pages.  

And really, the referer stuff can just as well be put into a CGI, like the Comments and TrackBack things.

So I am currently looking for things to take away ;-)
