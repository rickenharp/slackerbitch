I've just added the fix for RFC3156 conformance to the [mail2blog script](/mail2blog2.pl), that [Reverend Jim](http://revjim.net) [proposed](http://slackerbit.ch/archives/2003/02/01/blogging_via_mail_securely.html) to make it work with Evolution and Exim.

Since I have some free time, I think I'll look into adding image handling capabilities to the script, that sounds like a neat idea.
