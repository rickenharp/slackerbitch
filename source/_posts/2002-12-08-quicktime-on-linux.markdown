Over at [Mplayer HQ](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/), there's a new HOWTO on watching Sorenson-encoded QuickTime movies on Linux without having to use Wine.
I tried it out by downloading all the required files, and it works really good, I was able to watch all those trailer downloads I had lying around on my windows partition.
So except for some games (Total Annihilation, Ascendancy, Dark Reign), I can now do almost anything I need in Linux. Yay!
